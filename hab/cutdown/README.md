# HAB Cutdown Scripts
This is a collection of scripts for cutting down the High Altitude Balloon at a certain altitude or time.

There are also various testing scripts for desktop testing.

They need to run alongside the Pi In The Sky [tracker software](https://github.com/PiInTheSky/pits).

## Servo-Based Cutdown
See altitudeParser.py

Note that this is older code, but has been flown.

## Nichrome Cutdown
See nichromeCutdownController.py

To see how the cutdown circuit was built, see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1if0S766RU5wZ8iE2Y9442clqn32jEeF_cgAFM9OfUlE/edit)
